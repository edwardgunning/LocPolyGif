## A GIF for Locally Weighted Polynomial Regression


Use of the `gganimate` package to produce a GIF of locally weighted kernel regression.

The plot shows the effect of varying the bandwidth parameter on the global approximating function, the local approximating function at a point and the kernel weights.

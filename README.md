# FDA GIFs 

## It's all for fun! 

This repository is where I have some fun with the `gganimate` package to produce GIFs for some topics statistics. The idea is to use animations to describe statistical concepts that might not be intuitive through animation.

A lot of these will be related to functional data analysis (FDA), but not limited to this area. So far I've produced:


### Fourier Basis

### Gait Cycle FPCA (fda)

### Frequentist Confidence Intervals (CI)
